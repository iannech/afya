# AFYA
## About
Afya is a web application that will help enhance doctor-patient relationship. The managing system will create an online platform that helps doctors and patients interact easily. The main goal of the system is to accelerate access to medical services by enabling patients to book appointments with doctors. The system allows doctors to manage their booking slots online. 
Patients are allowed to book empty slots and those slots are reserved in their name. The system manages the appointment data for multiple doctors for various date and times. Each time a user visits a doctor his/her medical entry is stored in the database by doctor.

## Implementation
Each doctor will have an account in which patients are able to view and book an appointment with them. The doctor can accept appointments, reject appointments or refer the patient to another doctor in case they are not available at that time. In case the doctor rejects a patient’s request, he/she should notify the patient via email. This also applies when he/she accepts the appointment. The patient will receive an email with the time slot the doctor will be available and hence can visit the doctor at that time.
After the doctor treats the patient he/she should store the records in the database. The doctor can 
also view the list of patients he has treated. When the patient wants to book an appointment, he/she has to fill a form in which they have to provide their name and an email address that the doctor will use for communication. They also have to enter the doctor’s name they want an appointment with, the date and the time.
